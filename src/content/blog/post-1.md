I'm really having a blast with Astro. When I first thought about making my personal website, I turned to Gatsby. I have heard the name for many years, and remember when I checked out people's blogs and sometimes their footer will say Gatsby. Unfortunately, Gatsby in 2025 is in a frayed state (not quite dilapidated perhaps). I struggled with a ton of build errors, even following the official tutorial, and I realized a lot of the popular Gatsby plugins have not been updated for years. 

I was debating between 11ty and Astro, but went with Astro because I want to implement React components in my website in the future. 11ty is blazing fast, and Astro is almost just as fast - I think that's good enough for me. Having a low JS approach for websites is really what we needed after years of framework overload. 

Hope I will have more to share in the near future.
