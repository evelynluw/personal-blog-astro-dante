EcoShopper is the final group project of my UC Berkeley CS160 - User Interface Design and Development class. I worked with a great group of teammates, and we collaboratively planned, designed, implemented and demoed the app. I was in charge of building the cross platform mobile app, and I utilized [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev/), [Expo](https://expo.dev/) with **Typescript**, using UI libraries such as [**React Native Paper**](https://reactnativepaper.com/) to give it a smooth feel, and a barcode scanner module to achieve our feature. It was a blast to see the app turn out so close to our mockups! 


Check out our app demo here. Kinda nostalgic to see my old second hand $20 IKEA desk with poka dots on the camera scanner :\)
